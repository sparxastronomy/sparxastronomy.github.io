                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                     DEM L71 is a Type-1a Supernova(SN) which is a rich Iron(Fe). Proof of Hydrogen were also found as H-$\alpha$ emission were observed. Type-1a SNs are very essential in Astronomy as they act as the standard candles. Being rich in Iron and a Type-1a SN, its most likely that this SNR is due to death of a White-Dwarf star.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this study, I'm using optical data from WFC3 instrument onboard HST (<b>Propsoal ID: <a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/proposal_search.php?mission=hst&id=13282" target="_blank">1328</a> , PI: You-Hua Chu</b>) and X-ray Data from ACIS instrument of Chandra X-ray Observatory(CXO) (<b>Obs ID: 775, 3867, 4440</b>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    My main goal of the study is to create elemental distribution and analyze the spectrum of the target to verify previous results. Also, I’m learning about astrophysical radiative processes, so I’ll be testing new models for understanding the plasma phenomena at SNRs. 
                </p>
                <h3>Basic Data Reduction Steps</h3>
                <p>
                    The data from the ACIS instrument has been reduced using CIAO as per the standard procedure. For the HST data, I used Four filters: F450W, F555W, F656N and F814W. I used the pipeline reduced data for F656N filter but used multiple raw observation for other filter and combined them to create a master observation, following  <a href="https://github.com/spacetelescope/notebooks" target="_blank">STScI drizzlepac tutorial</a>. 
                </p>
                <h3>X-ray Data Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    I first split the data based on the energy distribution in various channel (Hard: 1.2-6 keV, Medium: 0.7-1.2 keV, and Soft: 0.1-0.7 keV) and the plotted them to check for relative contribution. [<b>NOTE : </b> that, I’ve combined observation from all the above mentioned observations.]
                </p>

            <div class="content-info">
                <p>
                    The above images are X-ray RGB images of the SNR. The first image is the un-smoothed image and in the second image each of the channel is smoothed using a <a href="https://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu/ciao/ahelp/csmooth.html" target="_blank"> gaussian kernel</a> ($\sigma_{min}$=3, $\sigma_{max}$=4).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In both the imgaes, one can clearly observe the double shock morphologies, and infact this is a text-book example of double shocks in SNR. The supersonic Forward shock(FS) is driven by the explosion. On the either side of the forward shock there is interstellar medium(ISM).  Behind the FS, the shocked ISM keeps accumulating, along with the ejected materials from the star. The freely expanding ejecta pushes on to the shocked ISM, and a contact discontinuity arises due to density difference between the ISM and the ejecta. As a result, the ejecta never reaches the FS, but insted there is a huge pressure build up behind the FS, which drives the Reverse Shock(RS) by pushing back onto the unshocked ejecta. The RS compresses the unshocked ejected heating the remaining ejecta. The heated freely expanding ejecta is seen in aqua-green color here and one can clearly observe the separation between ejecta and the shockwaves.

                    The below images will help better understand the above scenario. The first image is the x-ray image enhanced for better feature identification, and the next image is the x-ray image overlaid on top of the optical image, which shows the H-$\alpha$ emission observed by HST.

                <h3>Spectral Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    The below image shows the reigon used for spectral analysis. For spectral studies, background was subtracted from a small nearby region. The region descriptions are as follows.
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Central Region :</b> This is the central part of the SNR where the freely expanding ejecta is reheated.</li>
                        <li><b>Outer Rim :</b> Outer part of the SNR where the shock waves are visible</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-image single">
                <img src="/media/currently_working/DEM_L71/regions.jpg" alt="Regions for spectral analysis">
            </div>
            <div class="content-info">
                <h4>Central Region</h4>
                <p style='padding-top:1px'>
                    In the enhanced image one can see multiple blobs of emission, which are mainly the reheated ejecta. For this region the absoprtion model is <a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xanadu/xspec/manual/node268.html" target="_blank"><i>wabs</i></a> and for emission, plasma with two thermal components was considered. The emission model is <a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xanadu/xspec/manual/node215.html"><i>raymond</i></a>. Thus giving the final model as 
                    \[ wabs*(raymond + raymond) \]
                    The counts being low, we fit the data withh both using Chi-square and CStat and use the one with lower Q value. The fited data is as follows.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content-image multiples variable">
                <img src="/media/currently_working/DEM_L71/central_contrib_logon.jpg" alt="central region with log scaling">
                <img src="/media/currently_working/DEM_L71/central_contrib_logoff.jpg" alt="central region with no log scaling">
            </div>
            <div class="content-info">
                <p>
                    The model here as you can see sometimes underestimates and over estimates the data, near 1keV region. The fit statistics for the same are as follows:
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content-image multiples">
                <img src="/media/currently_working/DEM_L71/central_chi.png" alt="central region fit with chi-square">
                <img src="/media/currently_working/DEM_L71/central_cstat.png" alt="central region fit with CStat">
            </div>
            <div class="content-info">
                <p>
                    As you can seen, the chi-square statistics fits the data better, and reduced chi-squared values are:
                    \[ \chi^2_r ~ (\text{Chi-square}) = 20.427 \]
                    \[ \chi^2_r ~ (\text{CStat}) = 22.141 \]
                    Thus the model is in good agrement with the data. The values even though differs slightly from what was previously obtained the values now obtained are within $3\sigma$ limit. Just to have an idea of how hot the plasma is, the obatined componets translates back to $\approx 2.43,~ 8.54 ~~\mathbf{Million} ^\circ K$. Its really very very hot!! 
                    <br>
                    The good agreement of the <em>raymond</em> model suggest that the plasma is not so dense and is rather diffused.
                    <br>
                    The model also misses some hard emission lines beyoned 4 keV and is most likely because of higher uncertainity in the data beyoned 4 keV.
                    <br>
                    The data was also fitted with non-equilibrium, collisonal plasma models and in that case, the fit was not very good, although this doesn't suggest that the plasma is in equilibrium.
